Maybe there's a typo or maybe the user is showing that the same guess was made several times, but the feedback is the same each time. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the feedback means. In these kinds of puzzles, usually, the feedback after a guess gives two types of information: black (B) and white (C) pegs. A black peg indicates that a digit is correct and in the correct position. A white peg indicates that a digit is correct but in the wrong position. So, for example, if the guess is 4012 and the feedback is 0B 2C, that would mean that there are 0 black pegs and 2 white pegs. Wait, but the user wrote \"0B 2C\" for each guess.
