It all begins when he is admitted to the hospital for a routine check-up on the same day as another patient with a similar name, who tragically passes away. Due to the chaotic environment and a computer system glitch, John's medical records are accidentally swapped with those of the deceased individual. This mix-up leads to John's erroneous declaration of death. His family, unaware of the mistake, holds a funeral and buries what they believe to be John's body. Meanwhile, John, oblivious to the chaos, is discharged from the hospital and returns home, confused as to why no one has contacted him. A week later, when a neighbor checks in on him after noticing his absence, they find John alive and well in his house, unraveling the bizarre chain of events that led to his mistaken death and burial.",

Despite the absence of rain, the lack of natural light above ground means that the town is perpetually dark. The umbrellas serve as a visual cue to indicate when someone is entering or leaving the town, as they reflect light and can be easily spotted. Additionally, the umbrellas might help in shielding individuals from any artificial lighting within the town, which could be necessary for various reasons such as safety or to preserve natural circadian rhythms.",

The town is situated near an active volcano that frequently emits ash clouds. Although the town experiences clear skies and no rainfall, the ash fall from the volcano poses a significant threat to the residents' health and daily activities. To combat this, the townspeople have adopted the practice of carrying umbrellas to shield themselves from the falling ash, which can be both irritating and harmful. Additionally, the town's high altitude contributes to strong and unpredictable wind conditions, which can cause debris to become airborne. This further necessitates the use of umbrellas as a protective measure against potential hazards. The combination of volcanic ash and high-altitude winds has made the umbrella an essential item for daily life, ensuring the safety and comfort of the residents as they go about their routines.",
