She once publicly questioned the validity of my latest research on medieval manuscripts, suggesting it lacked depth and originality. During these disagreements, she would become very animated, often raising her voice and dismissing my points with a dismissive wave of her hand. It was clear she was not pleased with my work."

You know, he'd complain about how they didn't fit with the space, and she'd get really passionate about them. It was like watching a soap opera!

He said something about them being a distraction from the natural beauty of the park. Eleanor got really heated, saying they were meant to challenge people's perceptions. I think he called her work \"garish\" or something like that. There were a few other people around, like some artists and gallery staff, but nothing out of the ordinary."
