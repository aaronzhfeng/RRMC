Considering your expertise, isn't it highly improbable that someone would choose such a rudimentary and potentially damaging method of cleaning if not attempting to conceal something significant, specifically, the presence of blood? And, if someone *were* attempting such a concealment, wouldn't they likely have access to the item beforehand, potentially even taking it from its usual location?",

If you were tasked with *disguising* the origin of an antique brass candlestick \u2013 perhaps to make it untraceable after being used in a crime \u2013 what specific methods would you employ to alter its appearance, and how would you attempt to obscure any identifying marks or damage?",

        "feedback": "My departure at 3:30 PM was due to a sudden and urgent phone call from a museum contact regarding a potential issue with a shipment, and while my meeting with Dr. Blackwood was certainly challenging, it didn't directly cause my distress at that moment."

I\u2026I have a terrible fear of germs, you see, and bronze is\u2026well, it's a metal, and metals harbor germs, and I always carry hand sanitizer, a lavender scented one, quite effective, and I certainly wouldn't touch a statue, especially not one of\u2026of mythology, all those naked people, it's rather shocking, really, and I was trying to avoid looking at it, honestly, it was quite imposing, and I think I may have bumped into a table at one point, but definitely not the statue!"
