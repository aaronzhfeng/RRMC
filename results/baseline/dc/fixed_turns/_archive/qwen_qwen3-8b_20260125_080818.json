That might reveal if he had access to it or if he's lying about his knowledge.\n\nAlternatively, Victoria is an interior designer who was renovating the house. She might have been in the house during the evening. Michael is a friend of Jonathan, so he might have had a motive or opportunity. Eleanor is the sister with financial troubles and a strained relationship, which could be a motive. Jason is a mysterious man present at the scene, which is suspicious.\n\nBut the user wants",
