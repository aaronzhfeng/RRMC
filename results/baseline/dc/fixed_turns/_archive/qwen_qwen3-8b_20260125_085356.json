Jonathan was a reclusive historian living in the Old Manor House. The murder weapon is an antique brass candlestick. The key here is that the candlestick is an antique, so someone with knowledge of antiques might have access to it. Henry Caldwell is an antique dealer, so he's a likely candidate.

If Jason is the murderer, he might not know much about the candlestick since he's a mysterious figure. But the user's feedback suggests that Jason has no prior knowledge, so maybe he's not the one. \n\nVictoria Langley is an interior designer hired to renovate the house.
