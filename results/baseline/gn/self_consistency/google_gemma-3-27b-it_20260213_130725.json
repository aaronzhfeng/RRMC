We also know that 0 and 9 must be included since all digits 0-9 are present once.\n\nLet's consider possibilities, aiming to minimize overlapping digits and maximize the chance of hitting correct positions (although we expect zero for now based on the feedback).  We also want to test potential inclusions of 0 and 9.\n\nBecause both guesses had zero correct digits, we can deduce potential digits that are *not* in the secret number. The digits 1,2,3,4,5",
      "Okay, let's analyze the feedback and deduce the number.\n\n* **Turn 1: 1234 - 0 correct, 1 present:** This tells us that none of 1, 2, 3, or 4 are in the right spot, but *one* of them is in the number, just in a different position.\n* **Turn 2: 5678 - 0 correct, 2 present:**  Similar to Turn 1, none of 5, 6, 7, or 8 are in the right spot, but *two* of them are in the number, just in different positions.\n\nLet's combine this information. We know the number contains digits from the sets {1, 2, 3, 4} and {5, 6, 7, 8}. Because all digits 0-9 are unique, the number *cannot* contain any of 0 or 9. Therefore, the secret number must contain 4 distinct digits from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.\n\nNow, let's think about how to narrow down the possibilities."

The number contains three digits from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.\n2.  None of the digits 9 or 0 appears in any of the first two guesses. Thus, the secret number must contain 9 and 0.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities.  Since we need a 4-digit number and we know two digits are 9 and 0, we need to find two more. They have to come from {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}.\n\nLet's think about what numbers were *"

This suggests '1' *is* in the number, but not in the first position (since it was 'correct' in turn 2).\n\n2. **Looking at Turn 1 (1234):** One digit is correct, and one is misplaced.

The common digit between the two guesses is '1'. Since both guesses have '1' and both receive \"1 correct position\" feedback, '1' *must* be in the correct position in both guesses. This is a key insight. Therefore '1' must be the first digit.\n\nNow, knowing the number starts with '1', let's re-examine the feedback.\n\n* **Turn 1 (1234):**  Since '1' is correct, the feedback \"1 correct position\" means *exactly* one of 2, 3, or 4 is in the correct position.  The \"1 correct digit, wrong position\" means exactly one of 2, 3, and 4 are somewhere in the secret number, but not in their guessed position.\n* **Turn 2 (1056):** Since '1",

Since the rule states *all* digits 0-9 appear, we can also confirm 7, 8, and 9 are *not* in the number.\n2.  **1 is tricky:** 1 appears in both guesses, and has both correct position *and* correct digit (wrong position) feedback in both turns.

This is the most straightforward assumption.\n*   The digits 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are potentially misplaced.\n\nLet's assume '1' is fixed in the first position.
