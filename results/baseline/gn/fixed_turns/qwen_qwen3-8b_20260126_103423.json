Wait, no, actually, the problem says \"all digits of the number is unique such that all digits from 0 to 9 can only be present once.\" Wait, that might be a translation error. Maybe it means that all digits in the secret number are unique, and each digit from 0-9 can only be present once in the entire game? Or maybe it's that the secret number has unique digits, and each digit is only used once in the entire game? Hmm, maybe the original problem meant that the secret number has four unique digits, and each digit is only present once in the number. So no repeating digits in the secret number. So the secret number is four unique digits, and digits can't repeat in the number. So that's clear.\n\nNow, the previous guesses and feedback:\n\nTurn 1: Guess 1234, Feedback: 0 digits are present in the answer and in the correct positions, 2 digits are present in the answer but in different positions.\n\nTurn 2: Guess 1234 again",

Wait, but they did two turns with the same guess? That seems odd. Maybe there's a typo? Or maybe the user made a mistake in the feedback? Let me check again.\n\nThe user wrote: Turn 1 and Turn 2 both have the same guess, 0123, and same feedback. But that's strange because if you guess the same number twice, you'd expect the same feedback. But maybe the user intended to have different guesses but made a mistake. However, the problem states that all the rounds are finished, so maybe it's correct. Let me proceed with the given information.\n\nSo, the secret number is 4 digits, all unique. The guess 0123 has 0 correct digits in the right position and 2 digits that are present but in wrong positions. Wait, but if the same guess is made twice, the feedback is the same. So",
