Looking at 2345 and 9358:\n- 2345 has 2 correct positions\n- 9358 has 2 correct positions\n\nLet me focus on the digits that appear in multiple guesses and their positions:\n\nLooking at turn 6 (2345) with 2 correct positions and turn 13 (9358) with 2 correct positions:\n- 3 and 5 are common in both, so they're likely in the answer\n- 2 and 4 are in 2345, 9 and 8 are in 9358\n\nFrom turn 13 (9358): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nIf 3 and 5 are correct positions, then 9 and 8 are not in the answer (which matches turn 2)\n\nLet me reconsider: From turn 13 (9358) with 2 correct positions:\nIf positions 2 and 3 are correct (3 and 5), then the answer is _3_5_ or similar.\n\nFrom turn 6 (2345) with 2 correct positions:\nIf 3 and 5 are correct positions, then 2 and 4 are not in the answer.\n\nWait, let me be more careful. From turn 6 (2345): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nThis means 2 digits from {2,3,4,5} are in correct positions.\n\nFrom turn 13 (9358): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nThis means 2 digits from {9,3,5,8} are in correct positions.\n\nSince 3 and 5 appear in both, and we know from turn 2 that 5,6,7,8 are not in the number, then 3 and 5 must be in the answer.\n\nLet me check turn 24 (9561): 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions\nSince 5 is in the answer, it must be in the correct position.\nSince 6 and 9 are not in the answer, 1 must be in the correct position.\n\nSo we have 5 in position 2 and 1 in position 4.\n\nFrom turn 23 (7248): 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions\nSince 7,2,4,8 are not in the answer (from turn 2), this is confusing.\n\nWait, let me recheck turn 2: 5678 - 0 correct positions, 0 correct digits\nSo 5,6,7,8 are NOT in the answer.\n\nLet me look at turn 13 (9358): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nSince 5 is in the answer, and 8 is not in the answer (from turn 2), then 3 and 9 are in the answer.\nBut 9 is not in the answer (since 5,6,7,8 are not in the answer, and 9 would be in 9358).\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. If 9358 has 2 correct positions, and 5,6,7,8 are not in the answer, then 9 and 3 must be in the answer.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me look at what digits are definitely NOT in the answer:\n- Turn 2: 5,6,7,8 are not in the answer\n- Turn 12: 5,2,6,1 are not in the answer (since 0 correct positions, 0 wrong positions)\n\nSo 1,2,5,6,7,8 are not in the answer.\n\nThis means the answer uses only digits from {0,3,4,9} and one more digit.\n\nFrom turn 6 (2345): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nSince 2,5 are not in the answer, 3,4 must be in correct positions.\n\nFrom turn 13 (9358): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nSince 5,8 are not in the answer, 3,9 must be in correct positions.\n\nSo 3 and 9 are definitely in the answer.\n\nFrom turn 3 (9012): 1 correct position, 1 wrong position\nSince 1,2 are not in the answer, either 0 or 9 is in the correct position.\nSince 9 is in the answer, 0 is not in the answer.\nSo 9 is in the correct position.\n\nFrom turn 15 (7049): 1 correct position, 2 wrong positions\nSince 7 is not in the answer, 0 and 4 are not in the answer.\nSo 9 is in the correct position.\n\nThis confirms 9 is in the answer.\n\nSo far: 3 and 9 are in the answer, and 9 is in the correct position.\n\nLet me check turn 13 (9358) again: 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nIf 9 is in position 1 and 3 is in position 2, then the answer starts with 93_?\n\nFrom turn 6 (2345): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nIf 3 is in position 2 and 5 is in position 4, but 5 is not in the answer.\nSo 3 is in position 2, and 4 must be in the correct position.\n\nWait, let me be more systematic.\n\nThe answer uses 4 unique digits from {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} excluding {1,2,5,6,7,8} = {0,3,4,9}\n\nSo the answer uses 4 digits from {0,3,4,9}.\n\nBut we know 3 and 9 are in the answer. So we have 3,9 and two more from {0,4}.\n\nFrom turn 13 (9358): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nSince 5,8 are not in the answer, 3,9 are in the answer.\nIf 9 is in position 1 and 3 is in position 2, then 93_?\n\nFrom turn 6 (2345): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nSince 2,5 are not in the answer, 3,4 are in the answer.\nSo 3 and 4 are in the answer.\n\nSo we have 3,4,9 in the answer.\nThe fourth digit must be 0.\n\nSo the answer is some arrangement of {0,3,4,9}.\n\nFrom turn 13 (9358): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nIf 9 is in position 1 and 3 is in position 2, then 93_?\n\nFrom turn 6 (2345): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nIf 3 is in position 2 and 4 is in position 3, then 934_?\n\nLet me verify with turn 24 (9561): 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions\nIf the answer is 9340, then 9 is in position 1, so 9 is correct.\nBut 1 is not in the answer, so 1 is not in the answer - this is consistent.\n\nWait, let me check turn 24 (9561): 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions\nIf the answer is 9340, then 9 is in the correct position (position 1).\nSo 1 is not in the answer (which is consistent since 1 is not in {0,3,4,9}).\n\nLet me verify with turn 15 (7049): 1 correct position, 2 wrong positions\nIf answer is 9340, then 9 is in position 1, 0 is in position 4.\nSo 7,0,4 are not in the answer - but 0 and 4 are in the answer.\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nLet me reconsider turn 15 (7049): 1 correct position, 2 wrong positions\nThis means 1 digit from {7,0,4,9} is in the correct position.\nSince 7 is not in the answer, 0,4,9 are candidates.\nBut 0 and 4 are in the answer, so either 0,4, or 9 is in the correct position.\n\nIf 9 is in the correct position, then 0,4 are in wrong positions.\nIf 0 is in the correct position, then 9,4 are in wrong positions.\nIf 4 is in the correct position, then 9,0 are in wrong positions.\n\nLet me try 9340:\n- Turn 15 (7049): 9 is correct position 1, 0 is wrong position 2, 4 is wrong position 3, 7 is wrong position 4. This gives 1 correct, 3 wrong. But we need 1 correct, 2 wrong.\n\nLet me try 9430:\n- Turn 15 (7049): 0 is correct position 4, 9 is wrong position 1, 4 is wrong position 3, 7 is wrong position 2. This gives 1 correct, 3 wrong. \n\nLet me try 0934:\n- Turn 15 (7049): 0 is correct position 1, 9 is wrong position 2, 4 is wrong position 4, 7 is wrong position 3. This gives 1 correct, 3 wrong.\n\nLet me try 3940:\n- Turn 15 (7049): 9 is correct position 2, 0 is wrong position 4, 4 is wrong position 3, 7 is wrong position 1. This gives 1 correct, 3 wrong.\n\nLet me try 4930:\n- Turn 15 (7049): 9 is correct position 2, 0 is wrong position 4, 4 is wrong position 1, 7 is wrong position 3. This gives 1 correct, 3 wrong.\n\nLet me reconsider the constraints more carefully.\n\nLet me try 0394:\n- Turn 15 (7049): 0 is correct position 1, 9 is wrong position 3, 4 is wrong position 4, 7 is wrong position 2. This gives 1 correct, 3 wrong.\n\nActually, let me re-read turn 15: 1 correct position, 2 wrong positions.\nSo 1 digit is in the correct position, 2 digits are in the answer but in wrong positions, 1 digit is not in the answer.\n\nIf the answer is 0394:\n- 7049: 0 is in the answer and in position 1 (correct), 4 is in the answer and in position 4 (wrong), 9 is in the answer and in position 3 (wrong), 7 is not in the answer.\n- That's 1 correct, 2 wrong, 1 not in answer. This works!\n\nLet me verify this answer 0394 against all turns:\n\n1. 1234: 3 is in answer, wrong position. 0,9,4 not in answer. 1 correct, 1 wrong. But we said 0 correct, 2 wrong. This doesn't work.\n\nLet me try 3094:\n- Turn 1 (1234): 3 is in answer, wrong position. 0,9,4 not in answer. 0 correct, 1 wrong. But we said 0 correct, 2 wrong.\n\nI need to be more methodical. Let me try 4039:\n\nLet me try 4309:\n- Turn 1 (1234): 3 is in answer, wrong position. 4 is in answer, wrong position. 1,2 not in answer. 0 correct, 2 wrong. \u2713\n- Turn 2 (5678): 0,3,4,9 not in answer. 0 correct, 0 wrong. \u2713\n- Turn 3 (9012): 9 is in answer, wrong position. 0 is in answer, wrong position. 1,2 not in answer. 0 correct, 2 wrong. \u2713\n- Turn 4 (3456): 3 is in answer, wrong position. 4 is in answer, wrong position. 5,6 not in answer. 0 correct, 2 wrong. \u2713\n- Turn 5 (7890): 0 is in answer, wrong position. 9 is in answer, wrong position. 7,8 not in answer. 0 correct, 2 wrong. But we said 1 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nThis is getting complex. Let me try 3409:\n- Turn 1 (1234): 3 is in answer, wrong position. 4 is in answer, wrong position. 1,2 not in answer. 0 correct, 2 wrong. \u2713\n- Turn 2 (5678): 0,3,4,9 not in answer. 0 correct, 0 wrong. \u2713\n- Turn 3 (9012): 0 is in answer, wrong position. 9 is in answer, wrong position. 1,2 not in answer. 0 correct, 2 wrong. But we said 1 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nLet me try 9430:\n- Turn 1 (1234): 3 is in answer, wrong position. 4 is in answer, wrong position. 1,2 not in answer. 0 correct, 2 wrong. \u2713\n- Turn 2 (5678): 0,3,4,9 not in answer. 0 correct, 0 wrong. \u2713\n- Turn 3 (9012): 0 is in answer, wrong position. 9 is in answer, wrong position. 1,2 not in answer. 0 correct, 2 wrong. But we said 1 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nThe answer is: 4309",

    "raw_pred": "I need to analyze all the guesses and feedback to determine the 4-digit secret number.\n\nLet me work through this systematically by tracking which digits appear in which positions and which digits are definitely not in the number.\n\nFrom the feedback, I can determine:\n- Correct position (black pegs): digits in the right spot\n- Wrong position (white pegs): digits that are in the number but in wrong positions\n\nLet me analyze key clues:\n\nFrom Turn 21: 8163 \u2192 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nThis means 2 digits are in the correct positions, 2 digits are in the number but wrong positions.\n\nFrom Turn 23: 5280 \u2192 0 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nThis means none of these digits are in the secret number.\n\nSo digits 5, 2, 8, 0 are NOT in the secret number.\n\nFrom Turn 1: 1234 \u2192 0 correct, 1 wrong\nFrom Turn 2: 5678 \u2192 0 correct, 2 wrong\nFrom Turn 3: 9012 \u2192 1 correct, 0 wrong\nFrom Turn 4: 3456 \u2192 0 correct, 2 wrong\nFrom Turn 5: 7890 \u2192 0 correct, 2 wrong\nFrom Turn 6: 2345 \u2192 0 correct, 1 wrong\nFrom Turn 7: 6789 \u2192 1 correct, 2 wrong\nFrom Turn 8: 1593 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nFrom Turn 9: 4826 \u2192 0 correct, 1 wrong\nFrom Turn 10: 0719 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nFrom Turn 11: 8325 \u2192 0 correct, 1 wrong\nFrom Turn 12: 9147 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nFrom Turn 13: 5038 \u2192 0 correct, 1 wrong\nFrom Turn 14: 2961 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nFrom Turn 15: 7402 \u2192 0 correct, 1 wrong\nFrom Turn 16: 3589 \u2192 0 correct, 2 wrong\nFrom Turn 17: 6274 \u2192 0 correct, 2 wrong\nFrom Turn 18: 1835 \u2192 0 correct, 1 wrong\nFrom Turn 19: 9427 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nFrom Turn 20: 0651 \u2192 0 correct, 1 wrong\nFrom Turn 22: 4907 \u2192 0 correct, 2 wrong\nFrom Turn 24: 3794 \u2192 1 correct, 2 wrong\n\nSince 5, 2, 8, 0 are not in the number, I can eliminate them from consideration.\n\nLooking at Turn 3: 9012 \u2192 1 correct, 0 wrong\nSince 0, 2 are not in the number, either 9 or 1 is correct and in the right position.\n\nLooking at Turn 12: 9147 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nSince 7 is not in the number (from Turn 23), either 9, 1, or 4 is correct.\n\nLooking at Turn 14: 2961 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nSince 2, 6 are not in the number, either 9 or 1 is correct.\n\nLooking at Turn 19: 9427 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nSince 2, 7 are not in the number, either 9 or 4 is correct.\n\nLooking at Turn 21: 8163 \u2192 2 correct, 0 wrong\nSince 8, 6 are not in the number, 1 and 3 must be correct and in the right positions.\n\nSo 1 and 3 are in the secret number, and they're in the right positions.\n\nFrom Turn 3: 9012 \u2192 1 correct, 0 wrong\nIf 1 is correct, then 1 is in the right position (position 3).\n\nFrom Turn 21: 8163 \u2192 2 correct, 0 wrong\nIf 1 and 3 are correct, then 1 is in position 2 and 3 is in position 4.\n\nSo far: _1_3\n\nLooking at Turn 14: 2961 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nSince 2, 6 are not in the number, and 1 is in position 2, we need to check if 9 is in the number.\n\nWait, let me reconsider Turn 21 more carefully.\nTurn 21: 8163 \u2192 2 correct, 0 wrong\nThis means 2 digits from {8,1,6,3} are in the correct positions.\nSince 8 and 6 are not in the number, 1 and 3 must be in the correct positions.\nSo 1 is in position 2 and 3 is in position 4.\n\nSo the number is: _1_3\n\nLooking at Turn 10: 0719 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nSince 0, 7 are not in the number, either 1 or 9 is correct.\nWe know 1 is in position 2, so 1 is correct.\nThis means 9 is in the number but wrong position.\n\nLooking at Turn 12: 9147 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nWe know 1 is in position 2, so 1 is correct.\nWe know 7 is not in the number.\nSo either 9 or 4 is correct.\nSince 9 is in the number, 9 must be in the wrong position.\n\nLooking at Turn 19: 9427 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nWe know 2, 7 are not in the number.\nSo either 9 or 4 is correct.\nSince 9 is in the number, 9 is in the wrong position.\n\nLooking at Turn 24: 3794 \u2192 1 correct, 2 wrong\nWe know 3 is in position 4, 7 is not in the number.\nSo 3 is correct in position 4.\nWe know 9 and 4 are in the number but wrong positions.\n\nSo far: _1_3\nWe know 9 and 4 are in the number.\nWe know 9 is in wrong position, 4 is in wrong position.\n\nSince 9 is in the number but not in position 1, and 4 is in the number but not in position 3:\n- 9 must be in position 1 or 4\n- 4 must be in position 1 or 2 or 3\n\nBut 1 is in position 2 and 3 is in position 4.\nSo 9 must be in position 1.\nSo 4 must be in position 3.\n\nWait, that would make position 3 = 4, but we said 3 is in position 4.\nLet me reconsider...\n\nActually, 3 is in position 4, so 4 cannot be in position 4.\nIf 4 is in the number, it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\nPosition 2 = 1, Position 4 = 3.\nSo 4 must be in position 1.\n\nBut if 4 is in position 1, then 9 must be in position 3.\nBut we said 3 is in position 4.\n\nLet me recheck:\nFrom Turn 21: 8163 \u2192 2 correct, 0 wrong\nSo 1 is in position 2 and 3 is in position 4.\n\nSo the number is: _1_3\n\nFrom Turn 19: 9427 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nWe know 2, 7 are not in the number.\nSo either 9 or 4 is correct.\nWe know 1 is in position 2, 3 is in position 4.\nSo 9 or 4 must be in the correct positions.\n\nIf 9 is correct, it's in the right position.\nIf 4 is correct, it's in the right position.\n\nSince 1 is in position 2 and 3 is in position 4, \nIf 9 is in position 1, that works.\nIf 4 is in position 3, that would mean 4 is in position 3, but 3 is in position 4.\n\nSo 9 must be in position 1, and 4 must be in position 3.\n\nBut wait, we said 3 is in position 4, so 4 cannot be in position 3.\n\nLet me reconsider Turn 19 more carefully:\n9427 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\n2, 7 are not in the number.\nSo 9 or 4 is correct.\n\nIf 9 is correct, it's in the right position.\nIf 4 is correct, it's in the right position.\n\nWe know 1 is in position 2 and 3 is in position 4.\nSo 9 must be in position 1, 4 must be in position 3.\n\nBut that would make the number 9143.\n\nLet me verify with other clues:\nTurn 19: 9427 \u2192 9143 has 9 in position 1, 4 in position 3, 2 and 7 not in number.\nSo 9 is correct (position 1) and 4 is correct (position 3) - that's 2 correct, but we said 1 correct.\nThis is wrong.\n\nLet me go back to Turn 21: 8163 \u2192 2 correct, 0 wrong\nThis means 1 and 3 are in the correct positions.\nSo 1 is in position 2 and 3 is in position 4.\n\nSo the number is: _1_3\n\nTurn 19: 9427 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\n2, 7 not in number.\nSo either 9 or 4 is correct.\n\nIf 9 is correct, it's in the right position.\nIf 4 is correct, it's in the right position.\n\nSince we know 1 is in position 2 and 3 is in position 4:\nIf 9 is correct, it must be in position 1.\nIf 4 is correct, it must be in position 3.\n\nBut if 4 is in position 3, that means 4 is in the right position, but 3 is in position 4.\nSo 4 is in position 3, 3 is in position 4.\nBut we said 3 is in position 4, so this works.\n\nSo we have:\nPosition 1: ?\nPosition 2: 1  \nPosition 3: 4\nPosition 4: 3\n\nThe remaining digits are 9, 6, 7, 5, 2, 0, 8.\nBut 5, 2, 8, 0 are not in the number.\nSo we have 9, 6, 7.\n\nSo position 1 must be 6 or 9 or 7.\n\nLet's check Turn 12: 9147 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nWe have 9147, and we think the number is ?143\nSo 1 is correct in position 2, 4 is correct in position 3.\nThat's 2 correct, but Turn 12 says 1 correct, 1 wrong.\nSo this is inconsistent.\n\nLet me reconsider Turn 12: 9147 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nWe know 1 is in position 2, 3 is in position 4.\nSo 9 is in position 1, 4 is in position 3.\nBut that would make 9143, and 9147 has 9 in position 1, 1 in position 2, 4 in position 3, 7 in position 4.\nSo 9, 1, 4 are correct and in correct positions.\nThat's 3 correct, but Turn 12 says 1 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nI think I made an error. Let me restart with a more careful approach.\n\nFrom Turn 21: 8163 \u2192 2 correct, 0 wrong\nSo 1 and 3 are in correct positions.\nThis means 1 is in position 2 and 3 is in position 4.\n\nSo the number is: _1_3\n\nLet me check Turn 14: 2961 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nWe know 2, 6 are not in the number.\nSo 9 or 1 is correct.\nWe know 1 is in position 2, so 1 is correct.\nSo 9 is in the number but wrong position.\n\nSo 9 is in the number, and it's not in position 1.\n\nTurn 19: 9427 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nWe know 2, 7 are not in the number.\nSo 9 or 4 is correct.\nWe know 1 is in position 2, 3 is in position 4.\nSo 9 is in position 1, or 4 is in position 3.\n\nIf 9 is in position 1, then 9 is in the right position.\nIf 4 is in position 3, then 4 is in the right position.\n\nBut we said 3 is in position 4, so 4 cannot be in position 3.\nSo 9 must be in position 1.\n\nSo the number is: 91_3\n\nThe remaining digit from 0-9 that we haven't eliminated is 4, 6, 7.\nWe know 4 is in the number, and it's not in position 3 (since 3 is there).\nWe know 6 is not in the number.\nWe know 7 is not in the number.\n\nSo 4 is in position 3.\n\nThe number is: 9143\n\nLet me verify with Turn 19: 9427 \u2192 9143 has 9 in position 1, 4 in position 3, 2, 7 not in number.\nSo 9 is correct (position 1), 4 is correct (position 3) - that's 2 correct.\nBut Turn 19 says 1 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nThis is still inconsistent. Let me be more careful.\n\nLet me work with the fact that 5,2,8,0 are definitely not in the number.\n\nFrom Turn 1: 1234 \u2192 0 correct, 1 wrong\nSo 1,2,3,4 contains exactly one digit in the secret number.\n\nFrom Turn 3: 9012 \u2192 1 correct, 0 wrong\nSince 0 is not in the number, 9,1,2 contain exactly one digit in the number.\nSince 2 is not in the number, 9,1 contain exactly one digit in the number.\n\nFrom Turn 21: 8163 \u2192 2 correct, 0 wrong\nSince 8,6 are not in the number, 1,3 are correct.\nSo 1 is in the right position, 3 is in the right position.\n\nSo we have 1 in some position and 3 in some position.\n\nLet me try: 9143\n\nChecking Turn 1: 1234 \u2192 1 is in the number, 1 is in position 1, but we have 1 in position 2.\nSo 1 is in wrong position. This gives 1 correct, 0 wrong. But we said 0 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet me try 6193:\nCheck Turn 1: 1234 \u2192 1 is in the number, but 1 is in position 1 in our guess, and 1 is in position 2 in our answer. So 1 is in wrong position. That's 1 wrong, 0 correct. This matches Turn 1.\n\nCheck Turn 3: 9012 \u2192 1 is in the number, 1 is in position 2 in our answer, 1 is in position 2 in the guess. So 1 is in correct position. That's 1 correct, 0 wrong. This matches Turn 3.\n\nCheck Turn 21: 8163 \u2192 1 is in position 2, 3 is in position 4. That's 2 correct, 0 wrong. This matches Turn 21.\n\nSo 6193 is a candidate.\n\nLet me verify with more turns:\nTurn 19: 9427 \u2192 9 is in the number, 4 is not in the number, 2,7 not in number. \nSo 9 is correct, 4 is wrong. That's 1 correct, 1 wrong. This matches.\n\nTurn 24: 3794 \u2192 3 is in the number, 9 is in the number, 7,4 not in number.\nSo 3 is in position 4, 9 is in position 1. That's 2 correct, 2 wrong. But we said 1 correct, 2 wrong.\n\nThis doesn't work.\n\nLet me try 4193:\nTurn 1: 1234 \u2192 1 is in position 2, 4 is in position 1. 1 is in wrong position, 4 is in wrong position. 0 correct, 2 wrong. But we said 0 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nLet me try 9143:\nTurn 1: 1234 \u2192 1 is in position 2, 4 is in position 1. 1 is in wrong position, 4 is in wrong position. 0 correct, 2 wrong. But we said 0 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nLet me try 3194:\nTurn 1: 1234 \u2192 1 is in position 2, 3 is in position 1. 1 is in wrong position, 3 is in wrong position. 0 correct, 2 wrong. But we said 0 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nLet me try 7193:\nTurn 1: 1234 \u2192 1 is in position 2, 3 is in position 4. 1 is in wrong position, 3 is in wrong position. 0 correct, 2 wrong. But we said 0 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nActually, let me check Turn 1 more carefully:\nGuess: 1234, Feedback: 0 correct, 1 wrong\nThis means exactly one of {1,2,3",

This is inconsistent.\n\nLet me reconsider turn 18 more carefully.\n\nActually, let me check turn 18 (3961) again:\nIf 3 and 1 are in correct positions, and 3 is in position 1, 1 is in position 4.\nSo the number has 3 in position 1 and 1 in position 4.\n\nFrom turn 4 (3456): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nIf 3 is in position 1 and 5 is in position 2, then positions 1 and 2 are correct.\n\nSo we have:\nPosition 1: 3\nPosition 2: 5\nPosition 3: ?\nPosition 4: 1\n\nFrom turn 13 (9351): 2 correct positions, 1 wrong position\n3 in position 1 (correct), 5 in position 2 (correct), 1 in position 4 (wrong position)\nSo 1 is not in position 4, which means 1 is in position 3.\nSo 8 must be in position 4.\n\nTherefore: 3518\n\nLet me verify with a few more turns:\nTurn 1 (1234): 1,3,4 - 3 is correct position, 1 is wrong position. But 1 is in position 3, not 4. So 1 is in wrong position. That's 1 correct, 1 wrong. But we said 0 correct, 2 wrong. This is wrong.\n\nLet me restart with the correct approach.\n\nLooking at turn 1 (1234): 0 correct positions, 2 correct digits in wrong positions\nLooking at turn 4 (3456): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nLooking at turn 18 (3961): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\n\nThe number must contain 3 and 5 (from turn 4) and 3 and 1 (from turn 18).\nSo 3,5,1 are in the number.\n\nThe number contains 1,3,5,8 (since 0,2,4,6,7,9 are eliminated).\n\nIf 3 is in position 1 and 5 is in position 2 (from turn 4), and 3 is in position 1 and 1 is in position 4 (from turn 18), then:\nPosition 1: 3\nPosition 2: 5  \nPosition 3: ?\nPosition 4: 1\n\nThe remaining digit is 8, so it must be in position 3.\nThe number is: 3581\n\nLet me verify:\nTurn 1 (1234): 3 is in correct position (position 1) - but we said 0 correct positions. This is wrong.\n\nI need to be more careful about the positions.\n\nLet me work backwards from what I know for certain:\nDigits NOT in the number: 0,2,4,6,7,9 (from turns 9,20,22)\n\nDigits in the number: 1,3,5,8\n\nFrom turn 18 (3961): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nSince 9,6 not in number, 3,1 are in correct positions.\n\nFrom turn 4 (3456): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions  \nSince 4,6 not in number, 3,5 are in correct positions.\n\nSo 3 is in a correct position in both cases.\nIf 3 is in position 1 in both cases, then:\n- Position 1: 3\n- Position 2: 5 (from turn 4)\n- Position 3: ?\n- Position 4: 1 (from turn 18)\n\nThe remaining digit is 8, so it's in position 3.\nNumber: 3581\n\nLet me verify with turn 1 (1234): 0 correct positions, 2 wrong positions\n1,2,3,4 - 3 is in the number but in position 1, not position 4. So 3 is in wrong position.\n1 is in the number but in position 4, not position 1. So 1 is in wrong position.\n2,4 not in number.\nSo 2 correct wrong positions. This matches.\n\nLet me verify with turn 18 (3961): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\n3 in position 1 (correct), 1 in position 4 (wrong position) - this should be 2 correct positions.\nThis is wrong.\n\nWait, I'm making an error. If 3 is in position 1 and 1 is in position 4, then:\nTurn 18 (3961): 3 in position 1 (correct), 1 in position 4 (wrong position) = 1 correct, 1 wrong\nBut we need 2 correct, 0 wrong.\n\nSo 3 must be in position 1 and 1 must be in position 4, but that's not right.\n\nLet me try: 3 is in position 1, 5 is in position 2, 1 is in position 3, 8 is in position 4.\nSo number is 3518.\n\nTurn 18 (3961): 3 in position 1 (correct), 1 in position 4 (wrong position) = 1 correct, 1 wrong.\nThis doesn't match.\n\nActually, let me reconsider what \"2 correct positions\" means. It means 2 digits are in the correct position.\n\nIf the number is 3518:\nTurn 18 (3961): 3 in position 1 (correct), 1 in position 4 (wrong position) = 1 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nI think I misunderstood. Let me try 3581:\nTurn 18 (3961): 3 in position 1 (correct), 1 in position 4 (wrong position) = 1 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nLet me try 1538:\nTurn 18 (3961): 3 in position 4 (wrong position), 1 in position 1 (correct) = 1 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nLet me try 5318:\nTurn 18 (3961): 3 in position 2 (correct), 1 in position 4 (wrong position) = 1 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nLet me try 5138:\nTurn 18 (3961): 3 in position 3 (correct), 1 in position 2 (correct) = 2 correct, 0 wrong. \u2713\n\nSo 5138 satisfies turn 18.\n\nLet me verify with turn 4 (3456): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\n5138 vs 3456: 5 in position 3 (wrong), 3 in position 1 (wrong), 1 in position 2 (correct), 8 in position 4 (wrong)\nSo 1 is correct position, 3 is wrong position. Only 1 correct. This doesn't work.\n\nLet me try 1358:\nTurn 18 (3961): 3 in position 2 (correct), 1 in position 1 (correct) = 2 correct, 0 wrong. \u2713\nTurn 4 (3456): 3 in position 1 (correct), 5 in position 3 (wrong) = 1 correct, 1 wrong.

that's 1 correct.\n0 is in wrong position (position 2) - that's 1 wrong.\nThis matches.\n\nLet me verify with guess 19 (7265): 1 correct, 1 wrong\nIf the number is 2045:\n- 2 is in position 1 (but 7265 has 2 in position 2)\n- 6 is not in the number\n- 5 is in position 4 (but 7265 has 5 in position 4) - so 5 is correct\n- 7 is not in the number\n\nSo 5 is in correct position (position 4) - that's 1 correct.\nBut 2 is in position 1 in the answer, but in 7265 it's in position 2 - so 2 is in wrong position.\nWait, that's 2 correct positions, not 1.\n\nLet me try 2645:\nIf the number is 2645:\n- 7265: 2 is in position 1, 6 is in position 2, 5 is in position 4\n- 2645: 2 is in position 1, 6 is in position 2, 4 is in position 3, 5 is in position 4\n- 2 and 5 are in correct positions (positions 1 and 4)\n- That's 2 correct positions, but we need 1 correct.\n\nLet me try 2045:\nIf the number is 2045:\n- 7265: 2 is in position 1, 6 is in position 2, 5 is in position 4  \n- 2045: 2 is in position 1, 0 is in position 2, 4 is in position 3, 5 is in position 4\n- 2 is in correct position (position 1)\n- 5 is in correct position (position 4)\n- That's 2 correct positions, but we need 1 correct.\n\nI need to reconsider the constraint that 2,4,5 are in correct positions from guess 6.\n\nLet me try: 2_45 where the middle digit is 0.\nSo 2045.\n\nLet me recheck guess 19 (7265) with 2045:\n7265 vs 2045\nPosition 1: 7 vs 2 - different\nPosition 2: 2 vs 0 - different  \nPosition 3: 6 vs 4 - different\nPosition 4: 5 vs 5 - same\n\nSo 1 correct position (position 4), 0 wrong positions. But the feedback says 1 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nThis means there's a digit that's in the number but in the wrong position.\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood. Let me re-read the feedback.\n\nActually, let me try a different approach and work with the actual positions.\n\nLooking at guess 6 (2345): 3 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nThis means 3 of {2,3,4,5} are in correct positions.\nSince 3 is not in the number, 2,4,5 are in correct positions.\n\nSo the number has 2,4,5 in positions 1,2,3,4 in some arrangement where 3 of these are in correct positions.\n\nLet's say:\n- Position 1: 2 (correct)\n- Position 2: 3 (wrong) - but 3 is not in number anyway\n- Position 3: 4 (correct) \n- Position 4: 5 (correct)\n\nSo we have 2_45.\n\nBut we also know from guess 17 (5031): 1 correct, 1 wrong\nWe know 5 is in the number. If 5 is in position 4, that's correct.\nWe know 0 is in the number. If 0 is in position 2, that's wrong (since 0 is not in 2345).\nSo 5 is correct position 4, 0 is in wrong position.\n\nThis means 0 is in position 2 of the answer, but 0 is not in 2345.\nSo 0 is in position 2 of the answer.\n\nSo we have 2045.\n\nLet me verify with guess 19 (7265): 1 correct, 1 wrong\n7265 vs 2045\nPosition 1: 7 vs 2 - different\nPosition 2: 2 vs 0 - different  \nPosition 3: 6 vs 4 - different\nPosition 4: 5 vs 5 - same\n\nSo 1 correct position (position 4). \nThe wrong position means 1 digit is in the number but in wrong position.\nThat would be 7, 2, 6, or 5.\nWe know 5 is correct, 7,2,6 are not in the number.\nWait, 2 is in 2045 but in position 2, and in 7265 it's in position 2.\nSo 2 is in the same position - that's not wrong.\n\nActually, let me re-read the feedback more carefully.\n\nThe feedback says \"0 digits are present in the answer and in the correct positions, 2 digits are present in the answer but in the different positions\"\n\nSo for guess 19 (7265): 0 correct, 2 wrong means 2 digits are in the number but in wrong positions.\n\nBut 7265 has 7,2,6,5.\n2045 has 2,0,4,5.\nCommon digits: 2,5\nSo 2 and 5 are in the number.\nBut 2 is in position 2 in both, 5 is in position 4 in both.\nSo 2 and 5 are in correct positions.\nBut feedback says 0 correct positions.\n\nThis is a contradiction. Let me reconsider.\n\nLet me try 2645:\n7265 vs 2645\nPosition 1: 7 vs 2 - different\nPosition 2: 2 vs 6 - different  \nPosition 3: 6 vs 4 - different\nPosition 4: 5 vs 5 - same\n\nSo 1 correct position (position 4).\nThe 2 wrong positions would be 7,2,6,5. \nBut 5 is correct, so 7,2,6 are not in the number.\n2 is not in 2645, 7 is not in 2645, 6 is in 2645.\n\nWait, I think I'm misunderstanding what \"wrong position\" means.\n\nLet me re-read the feedback format:\n\"0 digits are present in the answer and in the correct positions, 2 digits are present in the answer but in the different positions\"\n\nThis means:\n- 0 digits are in the correct positions\n- 2 digits are in the number but in wrong positions\n\nFor guess 19 (7265) with 2645:\n7265: 7,2,6,5\n2645: 2,6,4,5\n\nCommon digits: 2,6,5\nIn 7265, 2 is in position 2, in 2645, 2 is in position 1. So 2 is in wrong position.\nIn 7265, 6 is in position 3, in 2645, 6 is in position 2. So 6 is in wrong position.\nIn 7265, 5 is in position 4, in 2645, 5 is in position 4. So 5 is in correct position.\n\nThat's 1 correct (5), 2 wrong (2,6). This matches.\n\nSo 2645 could be the answer.\n\nLet me verify with all constraints:\n\nGuess 6 (2345): 3 correct, 0 wrong\n2645: 2 in position 1, 6 in position 2, 4 in position 3, 5 in position 4\n2345: 2 in position 1, 3 in position 2, 4 in position 3, 5 in position 4\nCommon digits: 2,4,5\n2 is in correct position (1), 4 is in correct position (3), 5 is in correct position (4)\nThat's 3 correct positions. \u2713\n\nGuess 17 (5031",

So 8 or 9 is in position 4.\n\nFrom Turn 9 (2679): 0 correct in correct positions, 3 in wrong positions.\nWe have 2,6,7,9 in the answer.\n2 is in position 3, 7 is in position 1, so 6,9 are in wrong positions.\nSo 6 is not in position 2, 9 is not in position 4.\nWe have 7 4 2 _, so 6,9 must be in position 4.\n\nBut 9 is not in position 4, so 6 must be in position 4.\nSo we have 7 4 2 6.\n\nLet's check this against all clues:\n\n7 4 2 6\n\nTurn 1 (1234): 7 4 2 6 vs 1 2 3 4\n- 2 is in both positions 3 and 3 \u2713 (1 correct in correct position)\n- 4 is in both positions 2 and 2 \u2713 (1 correct in correct position)  \nWait, that's 2 correct in correct positions, but Turn 1 says 2 correct in correct positions. \u2713\n\nTurn 2 (5678): 7 4 2 6 vs 5 6 7 8\n- 6 is in position 4, 6 is in position 2 (wrong position) \u2713\n- 7 is in position 1, 7 is in position 3 (wrong position) \u2713\n- 5,8 not in answer, 6,7 are in answer but in wrong positions\nBut Turn 2 says 0 correct in correct positions, 1 in wrong position.\nWe have 6 in wrong position, 7 in wrong position. That's 2 wrong positions, but Turn 2 says 1.\n\nLet me reconsider. 7 4 2 6\n\nTurn 2 (5678): 7 4 2 6 vs 5 6 7 8\n- 6 is in position 4, 6 is in position 2 (wrong position) \u2713\n- 7 is in position 1, 7 is in position 3 (wrong position) \u2713\n- 5,8 not in answer, 6,7 are in answer\n- 6 is in wrong position, 7 is in wrong position\n- That's 2 wrong positions, but Turn 2 says 1 wrong position.\n\nThis doesn't work. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLooking at Turn 15 (6193): 1 correct in correct position, 0 in wrong positions.\nThis means 6 or 9 is in the correct position, and 1,3 are not in the answer (which we already know).\n\nLet me try to build the answer more carefully.\n\nFrom Turn 24 (5381): 0 correct in correct positions, 0 in wrong positions\nSo 5,3,8,1 are not in the answer.\n\nFrom Turn 8 (0135): 0 correct in correct positions, 0 in wrong positions  \nSo 0,1,3,5 are not in the answer.\n\nSo digits 0,1,3,5 are definitely NOT in the answer.\n\nFrom Turn 1 (1234): 2 correct in correct positions, 0 in wrong positions\nSince 1,3,5 are out, we have 2,4 in the answer in correct positions.\n\nFrom Turn 5 (7890): 2 correct in correct positions, 0 in wrong positions\nSince 0 is out, we have 7,8,9 in the answer with 2 in correct positions.\n\nFrom Turn 23 (7203): 2 correct in correct positions, 0 in wrong positions\nSince 0,2,3 are out, we have 7 in the answer in correct position.\n\nSo 7 is in the answer in the correct position.\n\nLet's say 7 is in position 1.\nSo we have 7 _ _ _\n\nFrom Turn 1 (1234): 2 correct in correct positions, 0 in wrong positions.\nSince 1,3,5 are out, 2,4 are in the answer in correct positions.\nSo 2,4 are in positions 2,3,4.\n\nFrom Turn 5 (7890): 2 correct in correct positions, 0 in wrong positions.\nSince 0 is out, 7,8,9 are in the answer with 2 in correct positions.\nWe know 7 is in position 1, so 8 or 9 is in position 2 or 3 or 4.\n\nLet's say 8 is in position 2.\nSo we have 7 8 _ _\n\nFrom Turn 1: 2,4 are in the answer in correct positions.\nSo 2,4 are in positions 3,4.\n\nFrom Turn 9 (2679): 0 correct in correct positions, 3 in wrong positions.\nWe have 2,6,7,9 in the answer.\n2 is in position 3, 7 is in position 1, 6,9 are in the answer.\nSo 6,9 are in wrong positions.\nWe have 7 8 _ _ \nIf 2 is in position 3, 6,9 must be in positions 4.\nBut 6,9 are in wrong positions, so 6 is not in position 4, 9 is not in position 4.\nThis is impossible.\n\nLet me try 9 in position 2.\nSo we have 7 9 _ _\n\nFrom Turn 1: 2,4 are in the answer in correct positions.\nSo 2,4 are in positions 3,4.\n\nFrom Turn 9 (2679): 0 correct in correct positions, 3 in wrong positions.\nWe have 2,6,7,9 in the answer.\n2 is in position 3, 7 is in position 1, 6,9 are in the answer.\nSo 6,9 are in wrong positions.\nWe have 7 9 _ _\nIf 2 is in position 3, 6 is in position 4, 9 is in position 2.\nThis works - 6 is in wrong position (position 4 instead of 3), 9 is in wrong position (position 2 instead of 3 or 4).\n\nSo we have 7 9 2 6.\n\nLet me verify:\n7 9 2 6\n\nTurn 1 (1234): 7 9 2 6 vs 1 2 3 4\n- 2 is in position 3, 2 is in position 2 (wrong) \u2717\n\nThis doesn't work. Let me re-read Turn 1.\n\nTurn 1 (1234): 2 correct digits in correct positions, 0 digits in wrong positions.\nThis means 2 digits from 1234 are in the answer AND in the correct positions.\n\nIf we have 7 9 2 6, then:\n1234 vs 7926\n- 1 is not in 7926\n- 2 is in 7926, but 2 is in position 3, not position 2. So 2 is in wrong position.\n- 3 is not in 7926\n- 4 is not in 7926\n\nThis gives 0 correct in correct positions, which contradicts Turn 1.\n\nSo my assumption that 7 is in position 1 is wrong.\n\nLet me try 7 in position 2.\nSo we have _ 7 _ _\n\nFrom Turn 1 (1234): 2 correct in correct positions, 0 in wrong positions.\n",

From Turn 19 (7410 \u2192 2,0): 7 and 0 are in the answer, and 4 and 1 are not.\nFrom Turn 13 (5219 \u2192 1,0): 5,2,1,9 - 1 is not in answer, 5 is not in answer, 9 is not in answer, 2 is in answer.\n\nSo from Turn 19: 7,0 are in answer, 4,1 are not in answer.\nFrom Turn 13: 2 is in answer, 5,9 are not in answer.\n\nSo far: 7,0,2 are in the answer.\nFrom Turn 12 (0487 \u2192 1,2): 0,7 are in answer, 4,8 are not in answer.\nFrom Turn 24 (4183 \u2192 1,0): 4,1,8,3 are not in answer.\n\nSo 4,1,8,3,5,9 are not in the answer.\nThis leaves 0,2,6,7 in the answer.\n\nBut from Turn 19, we know 7,0 are in answer.\nFrom Turn 13, we know 2 is in answer.\nSo we have 0,2,7 in the answer.\n\nLooking at Turn 12 (0487 \u2192 1,2): 0,7 are in answer, and 1 wrong position among 4,8,7.\nWait, 7 is in the answer, so 7 is in wrong position.\n\nFrom Turn 19 (7410 \u2192 2,0): 7,0 are in answer, 2 correct positions.\nFrom Turn 13 (5219 \u2192 1,0): 2 is in answer, 1 correct position.\n\nLet me reconsider Turn 19 more carefully:\n7410 \u2192 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nThis means 2 of {7,4,1,0} are in the correct positions.\nSince 4,1 are not in answer, 7,0 are in answer and in correct positions.\n\nSo 7 is in position 1, 0 is in position 4.\n\nFrom Turn 13: 5219 \u2192 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions\nWe know 2 is in the answer, so 2 is in correct position.\nSince 5,1,9 are not in answer, 2 must be in the correct position.\n\nSo 2 is in position 2.\n\nWe have 7 in position 1, 2 in position 2, 0 in position 4.\nWe need one more digit from {6,8}.\n\nFrom Turn 12 (0487 \u2192 1,2): 0,7 are in answer, 1 wrong position.\nWe know 0 is in position 4, 7 is in position 1.\nSo 1 wrong position means one of the remaining digits (4,8) is in the answer but in wrong position.\nBut 4,8 are not in the answer (Turn 24 shows 4,1,8,3 not in answer).\n\nWait, let me recheck Turn 24: 4183 \u2192 1,0\nThis means 4,1,8,3 are not in the answer.\nSo 4,8 are not in answer.\n\nBut Turn 12: 0487 \u2192 1,2\nIf 0,7 are in answer, and 4,8 are not in answer, then we have 0,7 in answer, and 1 wrong position.\nThe wrong position means one of the digits in the guess that's in the answer is in the wrong position.\nBut 0,7 are in answer, and 0 is in position 4, 7 is in position 1.\nSo 1 wrong position means 1 digit that's in the answer is in the wrong position.\n\nBut we've established 0 is in position 4, 7 is in position 1.\nSo 1 wrong position means one of the other digits is in wrong position.\nBut 4,8 are not in answer, so this is confusing.\n\nLet me restart with what I know for certain:\n- 4,1,8,3,5,9 are NOT in the answer (from multiple turns)\n- 7,0 are in the answer (from Turn 19)\n- 2 is in the answer (from Turn 13)\n- 7 is in position 1 (from Turn 19)\n- 0 is in position 4 (from Turn 19)\n- 2 is in position 2 (from Turn 13)\n\nSo the answer is: 72_0\n\nThe remaining digit must be from {6,8}.\n\nLooking at Turn 12 (0487 \u2192 1,2): 0,7 are in answer, 1 wrong position.\nIf 7 is in position 1, and 0 is in position 4, then 1 wrong position means one of the other digits is in wrong position.\nBut 4,8 are not in answer, so this is tricky.\n\nActually, let me check Turn 12 more carefully:\n0487 \u2192 1 correct position, 2 wrong positions.\nWe know 0,7 are in answer.\nSo 0 is in position 4, 7 is in position 1.\nThe 1 correct position is either 0 or 7 in correct position.\nThe 2 wrong positions are from 4,8.\n\nWait, 0 is in position 4, 7 is in position 1.\nIf 0 is in correct position, then 0 is in position 4. \nIf 7 is in correct position, then 7 is in position 1.\n\nBut we also know from Turn 19 that 7,0 are in correct positions.\nSo 7 is in position 1, 0 is in position 4.\n\nSo we have 7 in position 1, 0 in position 4, 2 in position 2.\nThe remaining digit must be 6 or 8.\n\nBut 8 is not in answer (Turn 24 shows 8 not in answer).\nSo the last digit is 6.\n\nThe answer is: 7260\n\nLet me verify with a few key turns:\nTurn 19 (7410 \u2192 2,0): 7,0 in answer, 4,1 not in answer. \u2713\nTurn 13 (5219 \u2192 1,0): 2 in answer, 5,1,9 not in answer. \u2713\nTurn 12 (0487 \u2192 1,2): 0,7 in answer, 1 wrong position. \u2713\n\n7260\n\nGuess: 7260",

Let's say the number is ABCD.\n\nFrom Turn 21 (5831): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nSo 2 of {5,8,3,1} are in correct positions.\nFrom Turn 22 (7294): 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions  \nSo 1 of {7,2,9,4} is in correct position.\n\nIf 5831 has 2 correct positions, and 58 is in positions 12, then 3 or 1 is also correct.\nBut from Turn 18 (6174): 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions\nIf 1 is in the number, and it's in position 4, then 1 is correct.\nBut Turn 21 says 1 is not in the number (since 5831 has 2 correct positions and 0 wrong positions, and 1 is not in the correct positions).\n\nWait, let me re-read Turn 21: \"1 digits are present in the answer and in the correct positions, 1 digits are present in the answer but in the different positions\"\n\nActually, I misread. Let me read carefully:\nTurn 21: \"2 digits are present in the answer and in the correct positions, 0 digits are present in the answer but in the different positions\"\n\nSo 5831: 2 digits in correct positions, 0 in wrong positions.\nThis means 2 of {5,8,3,1} are in the correct positions.\n\nLet me try: 58_4\nIf 5 is in position 1, 8 in position 2, 4 in position 4, then we need to find the third digit.\n\nLet me check Turn 18 (6174): 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions\nIf the number is 58_4, then:\n- 6 is not in the number\n- 1 is not in the number  \n- 7 is not in the number\n- 4 is in the number (position 4) \u2713\n\nSo 4 is in position 4, and 6,1,7 are not in the number.\n\nFrom Turn 21 (5831): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nIf 58_4, then 5 and 8 are in correct positions.\nSo 3 and 1 are not in the number.\n\nFrom Turn 22 (7294): 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions\nWe know 4 is correct in position 4.\nSo 7,2,9 are not in the number.\n\nThis confirms 4 is in position 4.\nWe have 5 in position 1, 8 in position 2, 4 in position 4.\nThe missing digit must be in position 3.\n\nAvailable digits for position 3: 0, 2, 6, 9 (but 6,9 are not in the number from our deductions)\nWait, let me recheck...\n\nLooking at Turn 15 (2468): 0 correct positions, 2 wrong positions\nThis means 2 of {2,4,6,8} are not in the number.\nWe know 4 is in the number, so 2,6,8 are not in the number.\n\nLooking at Turn 17 (4529): 0 correct positions, 2 wrong positions\nThis means 2 of {4,5,2,9} are not in the number.\nWe know 4 is in the number, so 5,2,9 are not in the number.\n\nSo far: 58_4, and 2,5,9 are not in the number.\nSo 1,3,6,7 are not in the number.\n\nThis leaves 0 and 2 for the third position.\nBut 2 is not in the number (from Turn 15 and 17).\nSo 0 must be in position 3.\n\nThe number is: 5804\n\nLet me verify this with a few key turns:\n\nTurn 18 (6174): 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions\nNumber: 5804, Guess: 6174\n- 6: not in number\n- 1: not in number  \n- 7: not in number\n- 4: in number, but in wrong position (position 4 vs position 4) - Wait, this is wrong.\n\nActually, 4 is in position 4 in both, so that's correct. That's 1 correct position. \u2713\n\nTurn 21 (5831): 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions  \nNumber: 5804, Guess: 5831\n- 5: correct position 1 \u2713\n- 8: correct position 2 \u2713  \n- 3: not in number\n- 1: not in number\nThat's 2 correct positions, 0 wrong positions. \u2713\n\nTurn 22 (7294): 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions\nNumber: 5804, Guess: 7294\n- 7: not in number\n- 2: not in number\n- 9: not in number  \n- 4: in number, position 4 \u2713\nThat's 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions. \u2713\n\nThe answer is 5804.",

The feedback says \"0 digits are present in the answer and in the correct positions\" - so 0 digits in the guess are in the correct positions in the answer.\n\nLet me focus on Turn 3: 9012 \u2192 1 digit in correct position, 0 digits in wrong positions\nThis means exactly 1 digit from 9012 is in the correct position in the answer.\nSince 9, 0, 2 are not in the answer (from previous deductions), 1 must be in the correct position.\nSo 1 is in the answer and is in position 3.\n\nFrom Turn 19: 7035 \u2192 1 correct position, 1 correct digit in wrong position\nSince 7, 0 are not in the number, 3 or 5 is in the correct position.\nAlso, one of 3, 5 is in the number but in wrong position.\n\nFrom Turn 23: 3185 \u2192 2 correct positions, 2 correct digits in wrong positions\nWe know 1 is in position 3, so 3 is in position 1, 5 is in position 4.\nSo 3 is in position 1, 1 is in position 3, 5 is in position 4.\nThis means 8 is in position 2.\n\nSo we have: 3 _ 1 _ 5\nBut wait, 3 is in position 1, 1 is in position 3, 5 is in position 4.\nSo it's 3 _ 1 5\n\nWe need to place 8 in position 2.\nSo: 3 8 1 5\n\nLet me verify this with some other clues:\n\nTurn 3: 9012 \u2192 3815 has 1 in position 3, so 1 is in correct position. \u2713\nTurn 5: 7890 \u2192 3815 has 8 in position 2, but 8 is not in 7890. No match. \nWait, this is wrong.\n\nLet me restart with a more careful approach:\n\nThe number contains only digits from {1, 3, 5, 8}.\n\nFrom Turn 3: 9012 \u2192 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions\nSince 9,0,2 are not in the number, 1 must be in the correct position.\nSo 1 is in the number and is in the correct position in 9012.\nThis means 1 is in position 3 of the answer.\n\nFrom Turn 5: 7890 \u2192 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions\nSince 7,8,9,0 are not in the number, this should be impossible.\n\nLet me check if I made an error. Looking at Turn 8 again:\nGuess: 0269, Feedback: 0 correct position, 0 correct digits in wrong positions\nThis means 0,2,6,9 are NOT in the number.\n\nFrom Turn 21: 9274, Feedback: 0 correct position, 0 correct digits in wrong positions\nThis means 9,2,7,4 are NOT in the number.\n\nSo 0,2,4,6,7,9 are NOT in the number.\nThe number must contain only from {1,3,5,8}.\n\nFrom Turn 3: 9012 \u2192 1 correct position, 0 wrong positions\nSince 9,0,2 are not in the number, 1 is in the correct position.\nSo 1 is in the number and is in the correct position in 9012.\nIn 9012, 1 is in position 3, so 1 is in position 3 of the answer.\n\nFrom Turn 23: 3185 \u2192 2 correct positions, 2 wrong positions\nIf 3 is in position 1, 1 is in position 3 (which we know), 8 is in position 2, 5 is in position 4.\nSo the number is 3815.\n\nLet me verify with Turn 1: 1234 \u2192 0 correct position, 2 wrong positions\n3815 has 1 in position 3, but in 1234, 1 is in position 3. This should be 1 correct position, not 0.\n\nI need to be more careful. Let me re-read Turn 3:\nGuess: 1234, Feedback: 0 correct position, 2 wrong positions\n\nIf 3815 is the answer:\n- 1234: 1 is in position 3 of 1234, but 1 is in position 3 of 3815. So 1 is in correct position. \nThis contradicts 0 correct positions.\n\nLet me reconsider Turn 3. If 1 is in the correct position in 9012, that means 1 is in position 3.\nBut if 1 is in position 3 of the answer, and in 1234, 1 is in position 3, then 1 is in correct position.\nThis contradicts the feedback of 0 correct positions.\n\nI think I misunderstood. The feedback means:\n- 0 digits are in the correct positions (same position)\n- 2 digits are in the answer but in wrong positions\n\nSo 1234 has 2 digits that are in the answer but in wrong positions.\nIf the answer is 3815:\n- 1234: 1 is in position 3 of 1234, but 1 is in position 3 of 3815, so 1 is in correct position.\nThis contradicts 0 correct positions.\n\nSo 1 cannot be in position 3 of the answer.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's say 1 is in position 1 of the answer.\nThen from Turn 3: 9012 \u2192 1 is in position 1 of the answer, 1 is in position 3 of 1234.\nSo 1 is in correct position in 9012, but 1 is in position 3 of 1234, so 1 is in wrong position in 1234.\nThis contradicts the feedback of 0 correct positions.\n\nI think I need to be more systematic. Let me work with the fact that 1 is in the number and 1 is in the correct position in 9012.\n\nIf 1 is in position 3 of the answer, then in 9012, 1 is in position 3, so 1 is in correct position.\nBut the feedback says 0 correct positions.\n\nThis means 1 is NOT in position 3 of the answer.\n\nIf 1 is in position 1 of the answer, then in 9012, 1 is in position 3, so 1 is in wrong position.\nIf 1 is in position 2 of the answer, then in 9012, 1 is in position 3, so 1 is in wrong position.\nIf 1 is in position 4 of the answer, then in 9012, 1 is in position 3, so 1 is in wrong position.\n\nSo 1 is in the answer, but not in position 3 of 9012. This means 1 is in position 1, 2, or 4 of the answer.\n\nBut Turn 3 says 0 correct positions. So 1 is not in the same position in 9012 and the answer.\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood the feedback. \nTurn 3: 9012 \u2192 0 correct positions, 2 wrong positions\nThis means 0 digits from 9012 are in the same position in the answer.\nSo 9 is not in position 1, 0 is not in position 2, 1 is not in position 3, 2 is not in position 4.\n\nSo 1 is not in position 3 of the answer.\n\nSince 1 is in the answer and 1 is not in position 3, 1 is in position 1, 2, or 4.\n\nFrom Turn 23: 3185 \u2192 2 correct positions, 2 wrong positions\nThis means 2 digits are in the correct position, 2 digits are in the number but in wrong positions.\n\nLet's say the answer is 3815:\n- 3185: 3 in position 1 of answer, 3 in position 1 of guess \u2192 correct position\n- 3185: 1 in position 3 of answer, 1 in position 2 of guess \u2192 wrong position  \n- 3185: 8 in position 2 of answer, 8 in position 3 of guess \u2192 wrong position\n- 3185: 5 in position 4 of answer, 5 in position 4 of guess \u2192 correct position\n\nSo 2 correct positions, 2 wrong positions. This matches!\n\nLet me verify with Turn 3: 9012 \u2192 0 correct positions, 2 wrong positions\n3815: 9 not in answer, 0 not in answer, 1 is in answer but in wrong position (position 3 vs position 3) - Wait, 1 is in position 3 of answer but 1 is in position 3 of 9012, so that's a correct position.\n\nThis contradicts the feedback. So 3815 is wrong.\n\nLet me try 8315:\nTurn 3: 9012 \u2192 8315: 9 not in answer, 0 not in answer, 1 is in answer and in position 3 of answer, 1 is in position 3 of 9012 \u2192 correct position. Still wrong.\n\nLet me try 5813:\nTurn 3: 9012 \u2192 5813: 9 not in answer, 0 not in answer, 1 is in answer and in position 3 of answer, 1 is in position 3 of 9012 \u2192 correct position. Still wrong.\n\nLet me try 3185:\nTurn 3: 9012 \u2192 3185: 9 not in answer, 0 not in answer, 1 is in answer and in position 2 of answer, 1 is in position 3 of 9012 \u2192 wrong position. \nBut 3 is in position 1 of answer, 3 is in position 1 of 9012 \u2192 correct position.\nSo 2 correct positions, not 0.\n\nI think I need to be more careful about what \"correct position\" means.\n\nActually, let me try 5318:\nTurn 3: 9012 \u2192 5318: 9 not in answer, 0 not in answer, 1 is in answer and in position 3 of answer, 1 is in position 3 of 9012 \u2192 correct position. Still wrong.\n\nLet me try 8135:\nTurn 3: 9012 \u2192 8135: 9 not in answer, 0 not in answer, 1 is in answer and in position 2 of answer, 1 is in position 3 of 9012 \u2192 wrong position.\nSo 1 is not in correct position. \nBut 3 is in position 3 of answer, 3 is in position 1 of 9012 \u2192 wrong position.\nSo 3 is not in correct position.\nBut 5 is in position 4 of answer, 5 is in position 4 of 9012 \u2192 wrong position.\nSo 5 is not in correct position.\nAnd 8 is in position 1 of answer, 8 is in position 1 of 9012 \u2192 correct position.\n\nThis gives 1 correct position, not 0.\n\nI think I should try 1835:\nTurn 3: 9012 \u2192 1835: 9 not in answer, 0 not in answer, 1 is in answer and in position 1 of answer, 1 is in position 3 of",

Let me check if 9104 could be the answer by checking it against other clues.\n\nActually, let me look at Turn 23: Guess 9014 \u2192 2 correct positions, 1 wrong position\nIf 9104 were correct, then 9014 would have 3 correct positions (9,1,4) and 0 wrong positions.\nBut it says 2 correct, 1 wrong - so 9104 is NOT the answer.\n\nLet me approach this differently by looking at the most definitive clues:\n\nFrom Turn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong\nFrom Turn 24: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong\n\nThis suggests that 9104 has 3 digits in correct positions, but since it's the same guess, it's likely that 9104 is the answer, but I need to verify.\n\nWait, I think I misunderstood - these are different guesses. Let me re-read carefully.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at Turn 11 and 24:\nTurn 11: Guess 9104 \u2192 3 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nTurn 24: Guess 9104 \u2192 3 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\n\nThese are the same guess with the same feedback, so 9104 has 3 digits in correct positions.\n\nBut let me check if 9104 could work with other constraints.\n\nLooking at Turn 1: 1234 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nIf 9104 were the answer, then 1234 would have 1 correct (the 1) and 1 wrong (the 2, 3, 4 are all wrong).\n\nLooking at Turn 2: 5678 \u2192 0 correct, 1 wrong\nIf 9104 were the answer, then 5678 would have 0 correct and 1 wrong - but 5,6,7,8 are all wrong, so this would be 0 correct, 0 wrong. This contradicts.\n\nSo 9104 is not the answer.\n\nLet me work with the constraint that 9104 has 3 correct positions, but I need to figure out which 3 positions.\n\nLet me check Turn 11 again: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong\nThis means 3 of {9,1,0,4} are in correct positions.\n\nLet me try to build the solution by elimination:\n\nLooking at all the clues, I need to find a 4-digit number with unique digits.\n\nFrom Turn 23: 9014 \u2192 2 correct, 1 wrong\nFrom Turn 24: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong\n\nThis suggests that 9104 has 3 correct positions, so 9,1,0,4 are in positions 1,2,3,4 respectively, but one of them is in the wrong position.\n\nActually, let me re-read Turn 24: 9104 \u2192 3 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nThis means 3 of the 4 digits (9,1,0,4) are in the correct positions.\n\nLooking at Turn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct positions, 0 wrong positions\nSame result.\n\nLet me try a different approach - let's say the answer is ABCD where A,B,C,D are the 4 digits.\n\nFrom Turn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct positions, 0 wrong\nSo 3 of {9,1,0,4} are in positions 1,2,3,4 respectively.\n\nFrom Turn 24: 9104 \u2192 3 correct positions, 0 wrong\nSame pattern.\n\nWait, I think I'm misreading. Let me re-read Turn 24:\nGuess: 9104, Feedback: 1 digits are present in the answer and in the correct positions, 2 digits are present in the answer but in the different positions\n\nNo, that's not right. Let me go back to the original:\nTurn 24: Guess: 9104, Feedback: 3 digits are present in the answer and in the correct positions, 0 digits are present in the answer but in the different positions\n\nSo 9104 has 3 digits in correct positions and 0 in wrong positions.\n\nLet me try: 9104 is the answer.\nCheck against Turn 1: 1234 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong\nIf answer is 9104, then 1234 has 1 correct digit (the 1) and 1 wrong digit (the 2). This works.\n\nCheck Turn 2: 5678 \u2192 0 correct, 1 wrong\nIf answer is 9104, then 5678 has 0 correct and 1 wrong. But 5,6,7,8 are all wrong, so 0 correct, 0 wrong. This contradicts.\n\nSo 9104 is not the answer.\n\nLet me reconsider the problem. Looking at Turn 11 and 24 - they're the same guess but different feedback? No, they're different turns with different feedback.\n\nActually, let me be more careful with Turn 11 and 24:\nTurn 11: Guess 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong\nTurn 24: Guess 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong\n\nThis is strange - same guess, same feedback. Let me re-read the problem...\n\nActually, I think there's a mistake in my reading. Let me go back to the original data.\n\nLooking at Turn 11: Guess 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong\nTurn 24: Guess 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong\n\nThese are different guesses, so I need to find the actual answer.\n\nLet me work with the most definitive information:\n\nLooking at Turn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong\nLooking at Turn 24: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong\n\nThese are the same guess, so I should trust the feedback.\n\nBut let me think differently. What if the answer is 1904?\n\nLet me test this against some clues:\nTurn 1: 1234 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong. If answer is 1904, then 1 is correct, 9,0,4 are wrong. This works (1 is correct).\nTurn 2: 5678 \u2192 0 correct, 1 wrong. If answer is 1904, then 5,6,7,8 are all wrong. This works (0 correct).\nTurn 3: 9012 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong. If answer is 1904, then 1 is correct, 9,0,2 are wrong. This works (1 correct).\nTurn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong. If answer is 1904, then 1,0,4 are correct positions. But 1 is in position 1, 0 is in position 3, 4 is in position 4. 9 is in position 1 but answer has 1 in position 1, so 9 is wrong. This would be 2 correct, 1 wrong. This doesn't match.\n\nLet me try 1094:\nTurn 1: 1234 \u2192 1 correct, 1 wrong. 1 is correct. This works.\nTurn 2: 5678 \u2192 0 correct, 1 wrong. All wrong. This works.\nTurn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong. 9,1,0,4 - 1 is in position 2, 0 in position 3, 4 in position 4. 9 is in position 1 but answer has 1 in position 1. So 1,0,4 are correct positions. 9 is wrong. So 3 correct, 0 wrong. This works!\n\nLet me verify 1094 against more clues:\nTurn 12: 1904 \u2192 1 correct, 2 wrong. 1 is correct, 9,0,4 are wrong. This works (1 correct).\nTurn 13: 1940 \u2192 0 correct, 3 wrong. 1,9,4,0 are all wrong. This works (0 correct).\n\nActually, let me be more methodical. Looking at Turn 23: 9014 \u2192 2 correct, 1 wrong\nIf answer is 1094, then 9,0,1,4 - 0 is in position 2, 1 is in position 1, 4 is in position 4. 9 is in position 1 but answer has 1 in position 1. So 0,1,4 are correct positions. That's 3 correct, 1 wrong. This contradicts 2 correct, 1 wrong.\n\nLet me try 1409:\nTurn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong. 9,1,0,4 - 9 is in position 1 but answer has 1 in position 1. 1 is in position 2 but answer has 4 in position 2. 0 is in position 3 but answer has 0 in position 3. 4 is in position 4 but answer has 9 in position 4. So 0 is correct, 4 is correct. 9 and 1 are wrong. So 2 correct, 2 wrong. This doesn't match.\n\nLet me try 1490:\nTurn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong. 9,1,0,4 - 9 is in position 1 but answer has 1 in position 1. 1 is in position 2 but answer has 4 in position 2. 0 is in position 3 but answer has 9 in position 3. 4 is in position 4 but answer has 0 in position 4. So 0 is correct, 4 is correct. 9 and 1 are wrong. So 2 correct, 2 wrong. Doesn't match.\n\nLet me try 1049:\nTurn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong. 9,1,0,4 - 9 is in position 1 but answer has 1 in position 1. 1 is in position 2 but answer has 0 in position 2. 0 is in position 3 but answer has 4 in position 3. 4 is in position 4 but answer has 9 in position 4. So 0 is correct, 4 is correct. 9 and 1 are wrong. So 2 correct, 2 wrong. Doesn't match.\n\nLet me try 1904:\nTurn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong. 9,1,0,4 - 9 is in position 1 but answer has 1 in position 1. 1 is in position 2 but answer has 9 in position 2. 0 is in position 3 but answer has 0 in position 3. 4 is in position 4 but answer has 4 in position 4. So 0 and 4 are correct. 9 and 1 are wrong. So 2 correct, 2 wrong. Doesn't match.\n\nWait, I think I'm misreading what \"correct positions\" means. Let me re-read Turn 11:\nGuess: 9104, Feedback: 3 digits are present in the answer and in the correct positions, 0 digits are present in the answer but in the different positions\n\nThis means 3 of the 4 digits in 9104 are in the correct positions in the secret number.\n\nSo if the secret number is ABCD:\n- If 9 is in position 1 of the secret number, that's correct\n- If 1 is in position 2 of the secret number, that's correct  \n- If 0 is in position 3 of the secret number, that's correct\n- If 4 is in position 4 of the secret number, that's correct\n\nLet me try 1940:\nTurn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong. \nIf secret is 1940, then:\n- 9 is in position 2 of 9104, but secret has 9 in position 2. \u2713\n- 1 is in position 1 of 9104, but secret has 1 in position 1. \u2713  \n- 0 is in position 3 of 9104, but secret has 4 in position 3. \u2717\n- 4 is in position 4 of 9104, but secret has 0 in position 4. \u2717\n\nSo 2 correct positions (9 and 1), 2 wrong positions (0 and 4). This contradicts 3 correct, 0 wrong.\n\nLet me try 1049:\nTurn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong.\nIf secret is 1049, then:\n- 9 is in position 1 of 9104, but secret has 1 in position 1. \u2717\n- 1 is in position 2 of 9104, but secret has 0 in position 2. \u2717\n- 0 is in position 3 of 9104, but secret has 4 in position 3. \u2717\n- 4 is in position 4 of 9104, but secret has 9 in position 4. \u2717\n\nThis would be 0 correct, 4 wrong. Contradicts.\n\nLet me try 1409:\nTurn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong.\nIf secret is 1409, then:\n- 9 is in position 1 of 9104, but secret has 1 in position 1. \u2717\n- 1 is in position 2 of 9104, but secret has 4 in position 2. \u2717\n- 0 is in position 3 of 9104, but secret has 0 in position 3. \u2713\n- 4 is in position 4 of 9104, but secret has 9 in position 4. \u2717\n\nThis would be 1 correct, 3 wrong. Contradicts.\n\nLet me try 1940 again, but be more careful:\nTurn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong.\nIf secret is 1940, then:\n- 9 is in position 2 of 9104, secret has 9 in position 2. \u2713\n- 1 is in position 1 of 9104, secret has 1 in position 1. \u2713\n- 0 is in position 3 of 9104, secret has 4 in position 3. \u2717\n- 4 is in position 4 of 9104, secret has 0 in position 4. \u2717\n\nSo 2 correct, 2 wrong. Not matching.\n\nLet me try 4109:\nTurn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong.\nIf secret is 4109, then:\n- 9 is in position 1 of 9104, secret has 4 in position 1. \u2717\n- 1 is in position 2 of 9104, secret has 1 in position 2. \u2713\n- 0 is in position 3 of 9104, secret has 0 in position 3. \u2713\n- 4 is in position 4 of 9104, secret has 9 in position 4. \u2717\n\nSo 2 correct, 2 wrong. Not matching.\n\nLet me try 4019:\nTurn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong.\nIf secret is 4019, then:\n- 9 is in position 1 of 9104, secret has 4 in position 1. \u2717\n- 1 is in position 2 of 9104, secret has 0 in position 2. \u2717\n- 0 is in position 3 of 9104, secret has 1 in position 3. \u2717\n- 4 is in position 4 of 9104, secret has 9 in position 4. \u2717\n\nSo 0 correct, 4 wrong. Not matching.\n\nLet me try 0149:\nTurn 11: 9104 \u2192 3 correct, 0 wrong.\nIf secret is 0149, then:\n- 9 is in position 1 of 9104, secret has 0 in position 1. \u2717\n- 1 is in position 2 of 9104, secret has ",
