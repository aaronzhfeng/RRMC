Let me go through each guess and feedback step by step.\n\nStarting with Turn 1: Guess 2650. Feedback says 1 digit is correct and in the right position, and another digit is present but in the wrong position. So, among 2, 6, 5, 0, one is in the correct spot, and another is in the number but misplaced.\n\nTurn 2: Guess 1234. Feedback is 2 correct digits in the right positions, 0 correct digits in wrong positions. So two digits from 1,2,3,4 are in the correct positions. But since Turn 3, 4, 6,7,8,9 all guess 1234 again with same feedback, that suggests that the correct digits in the right positions are consistent. Wait, but Turn 5 is 3895 with feedback 0 correct positions, 1 digit in wrong position. So maybe the secret number has some digits from 1234 but not all.\n\nWait, but Turn",

Maybe it means that all digits in the secret number are unique, so no repeating digits. So the secret number has 4 unique digits, and digits from 0-9 can only be present once in the entire number?
