Wait, no, actually, the problem says \"all digits of the number is unique such that all digits from 0 to 9 can only be present once.\" Wait, that might be a translation error. Maybe it means that all digits in the secret number are unique, so no repeating digits. Because a 4-digit number can't have all digits from 0-9, since that would be 10 digits. So probably, the secret number has 4 unique digits, none repeated. So each digit is unique, but not necessarily covering all digits from 0-9. So that's clarified.\n\nNow, the previous guesses and feedback:\n\nTurn 1: Guess 0123, Feedback: 0 correct digits in the correct position, 2 digits present but in different positions.\n\nTurn 2: Guess 0123 again, same feedback. Wait, same guess, same feedback? That's odd. Maybe a typo? Or maybe the user made a mistake in inputting the feedback? Or maybe it's a trick",

Wait, that's the same feedback every time? That seems odd. Let me think.\n\nFirst, the secret number has four unique digits. The guess 0123 is the same every time, and each time the feedback is 0 correct digits in the right place and 2 digits correct but misplaced. But since the same guess is repeated four times, maybe there's something wrong here. Wait, maybe the user made a typo? Or maybe the feedback is the same each time, which would mean that the secret number has two digits from 0123 but not in the correct positions. But if the same guess is repeated, the feedback should be the same, which it is. So the secret number must have exactly two digits from 0,1,2,3, but not in the positions they are in the guess.
