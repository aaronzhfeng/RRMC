The user gave two guesses, both 0123, and the feedback was the same each time: 0 digits in the correct position and 2 digits present but in different positions. Wait, but they did two turns with the same guess? That seems odd. Maybe there's a typo? Or maybe the user meant that after two turns, the feedback was the same? Let me check again.\n\nThe user wrote: Turn 1 and Turn 2 both have the guess 0123 with the same feedback. That's strange because if the same guess is made twice, the feedback should be the same, which it is. But how does that help us? Let me think.\n\nFirst, the secret number has 4 unique digits. The guess 0123 has digits 0,1,2,3. The feedback says 0 digits are in the correct position. So none of 0,1,2,3 are in the correct positions. Also, 2 digits are present in the answer but in different positions. So two of these digits are in the secret",

Wait, no, actually, the problem says \"all digits of the number is unique such that all digits from 0 to 9 can only be present once.\" Wait, that might be a translation error. Maybe it means that all digits in the secret number are unique, so no repeating digits. So the secret number has 4 unique digits, and the digits from 0-9 can only be present once in the entire number? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's that the secret number has 4 digits, all unique, so each digit is different. So digits can't repeat in the secret number. So the secret number is 4 digits, all unique, and digits from 0-9 are allowed, but each digit in the secret number is unique. So, for example, 1234 is allowed, but 1123 is not.\n\nNow, the previous guesses and feedback: Turn 1 and Turn 2 both guessed 1234, and the feedback was the same: 1",
