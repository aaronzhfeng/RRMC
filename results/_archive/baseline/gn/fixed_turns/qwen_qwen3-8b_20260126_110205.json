The game has been played multiple times with the same guess of 0123, and each time the feedback is the same: 1 digit in the correct position and 2 digits present but in the wrong positions. Wait, but the user mentioned that after Turn 1, the feedback was 1 correct position and 2 digits present elsewhere. Then Turns 2 through 9 all have the same feedback. That seems odd because if the same guess is repeated, the feedback should change if the secret number is different. But since the feedback is the same every time, maybe there's something wrong here. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the input, but assuming the information is correct, let's proceed.\n\nFirst, let's note that the secret number has four unique digits. The guess 0123 is used repeatedly, and each time the feedback is 1 correct digit in the correct position and 2 digits present in the wrong positions. Wait, but that's the same feedback every time. That suggests that the secret number has exactly one digit in the",
