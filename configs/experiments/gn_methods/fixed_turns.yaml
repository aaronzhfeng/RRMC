# GN Baseline: LLM guesses until correct or out of turns
#
# Standard LLM-generated guesses with no early stopping.
# For GN, every guess gives useful feedback (bulls/cows), so
# there's no benefit to stopping early — just keep guessing.
# The game ends naturally when the LLM guesses correctly (4 bulls).
