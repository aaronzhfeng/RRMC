# GN + DQS (Deliberative Question Selection)
#
# Uses DQS to select optimal guesses via entropy reduction.
# At each turn, DQS:
#   1. Generates M candidate guesses (LLM + answer-set sampling)
#   2. Scores each by expected entropy reduction (deterministic)
#   3. Picks the guess that maximally shrinks the answer set
#
# Unlike DC, GN DQS requires NO extra LLM simulation calls —
# scoring is pure computation over the 5040-number answer set.
# The only LLM cost is 1 call per turn for candidate generation.
