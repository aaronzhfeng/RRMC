# DQS (Deliberative Question Selection) + Fixed Turns stopping
#
# Tests DQS question selection paired with fixed-turns stopping.
# DQS replaces the default LLM-generated questions with questions
# chosen through a deliberative simulate-and-evaluate pipeline.
#
# Expected to improve question quality → better accuracy at same # turns.
#
# Inference cost: ~(2 * M * R + 1) extra calls per turn on top of
# the stopping rule's cost.  With M=5, R=2: ~21 calls/turn.
