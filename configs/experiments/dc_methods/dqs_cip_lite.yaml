# DQS (Deliberative Question Selection) + CIP-Lite stopping
#
# Tests DQS question selection paired with CIP-Lite adaptive stopping.
# DQS improves question quality; CIP-Lite decides when the model is
# confident enough to stop.
#
# This combines the best question selector (DQS) with the best
# adaptive stopping rule (CIP-Lite) for a "full pipeline" experiment.
