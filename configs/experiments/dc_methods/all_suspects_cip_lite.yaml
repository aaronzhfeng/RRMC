# AllSuspects + CIP-Lite — best-performing stopping + structured coverage (DC)
# Questions every suspect at least once, then uses CIP-Lite to decide when to stop.
# CIP-Lite was the best baseline at 45% accuracy on 20 puzzles.
#
# Controlled variables (match cip_lite baseline exactly):
#   k_samples: 8, set_size_threshold: 1, max_turns: 25
# Only difference: require_all_suspects = true
