# DQS (Deliberative Question Selection) defaults
#
# DQS is a question-selection strategy, not a stopping rule.
# It works alongside any stopping rule by improving the quality
# of questions asked at each turn.
#
# Inference cost per turn: ~(2 * m_candidates * r_simulations + 1) LLM calls

m_candidates: 5         # Number of candidate questions generated per turn (M)
r_simulations: 2        # Number of simulated responses per candidate (R)
temperature: 0.7        # Temperature for candidate generation & simulation
eval_temperature: 0.3   # Temperature for branch evaluation
